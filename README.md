# Description

This sample app masks a phone call through a Bandwidth phone number using Bandwidth's Bridge BXML verb. Once configured, anyone who calls your Bandwidth phone number will be bridged to the masked number without either party members knowing the other's phone number.

In the Bandwidth Dashboard, set the Application's `Call initiated callback URL` to `<BASE_CALLBACK_URL>/callbacks/inboundCall`. This can also be done via the Dashboard API by setting `CallInitiatedCallbackUrl`. Once configured, any calls made to a number associated with that application will cause this app to create a new call to the `USER_NUMBER`. This call will come from your `BW_NUMBER` and the original call will be bridged to this one once accepted.

Once the callee at `USER_NUMBER` confirms the call, the call flow will appear as such:

`Random Number <-> BW_NUMBER <-> USER_NUMBER` - if the `BW_NUMBER` environment variable is the number called.

`Random Number <-> Other BW_NUMBER <-> BW_NUMBER <-> USER_NUMBER` - if the `BW_NUMBER` environment variable is different from the number called.

# Pre-Requisites

In order to use the Bandwidth API users need to set up the appropriate application at the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and create API tokens.

To create an application log into the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and navigate to the `Applications` tab.  Fill out the **New Application** form selecting the service (Messaging or Voice) that the application will be used for.  All Bandwidth services require publicly accessible Callback URLs, for more information on how to set one up see [Callback URLs](#callback-urls).

For more information about API credentials see our [Account Credentials](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/account/credentials) page.

# Running the Application

To install the required packages for this app, run the command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use the following command to run the application:

```sh
python main.py
```

# Environmental Variables

The sample app uses the below environmental variables.

```sh
BW_ACCOUNT_ID                   # Your Bandwidth Account Id
BW_USERNAME                     # Your Bandwidth API Username
BW_PASSWORD                     # Your Bandwidth API Password
BW_NUMBER                       # Your Bandwidth Phone Number
USER_NUMBER                     # The phone number to be called with this application
BW_VOICE_APPLICATION_ID         # Your Voice Application Id created in the dashboard
BASE_CALLBACK_URL               # Your public base url
LOCAL_PORT                      # The port number you wish to run the sample on
```

# Callback URLs

For a detailed introduction, check out our [Bandwidth Voice Callbacks](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/voice/quickStart#configuring-callback-urls) page.

Below are the callback paths:
* `/callbacks/inboundCall`
* `/callbacks/outboundCall`

## Ngrok

A simple way to set up a local callback URL for testing is to use the free tool [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  
After you have downloaded and installed `ngrok` run the following command to open a public tunnel to your port (`$LOCAL_PORT`)

```cmd
ngrok http $LOCAL_PORT
```

You can view your public URL at `http://127.0.0.1:4040` after ngrok is running.  You can also view the status of the tunnel and requests/responses here.

Once your public ngrok url has been created, you can use it as the `BASE_CALLBACK_URL` environmental variable and set it in the voice application created in the [pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) section.
